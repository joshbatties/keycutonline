### Payment Flow
1. User completes order/booking form
2. Frontend calls `/api/orders` or `/api/bookings`
3. Backend creates database record with `payment_status: 'pending'`
4. Backend creates Stripe Payment Intent
5. Frontend displays Stripe Elements checkout
6. User completes payment
7. Stripe webhook updates `payment_status: 'paid'`
8. User redirected to success page with tracking token

### Authentication Flow
- **Public users**: No auth required for orders/bookings/tracking
- **Registered users**: Can view order history at `/my-orders`
- **Admin users**: Protected routes at `/admin/*` with Supabase auth
- Middleware handles session refresh for all routes

### File Upload Flow (Secure)
1. User selects photos in `KeyPhotoUpload` component
2. Component calls `/api/upload` with FormData
3. Backend uploads to Supabase Storage bucket 'keycutonline' (private)
4. Generates signed URLs (7-day expiry) for secure access
5. Returns signed URLs to frontend (not publicly accessible)
6. URLs stored in `orders.photo_urls` array

- ✅ Supabase authentication
- ✅ Environment variables for secrets
- ✅ HTTPS enforced by Vercel

### Needs Attention
- ❌ Rate limiting on API routes
- ❌ Input sanitization (XSS prevention)

- ❌ File upload validation (file type, size limits)

## Deployment Checklist

### Before Going Live
- [ ] Set up Stripe webhook endpoint in Stripe Dashboard
- [ ] Configure production Stripe keys
- [ ] Set up email service (Resend/SendGrid)
- [ ] Implement RLS policies
- [ ] Add rate limiting
- [ ] Set up error monitoring (Sentry)
- [ ] Configure custom domain
- [ ] Set up SSL certificate
- [ ] Test payment flow end-to-end
- [ ] Test email notifications
- [ ] Load test critical endpoints
- [ ] Set up database backups
- [ ] Configure CORS policies
- [ ] Add terms of service and privacy policy
- [ ] Set up customer support system
- [ ] Train admin users
- [ ] Prepare launch marketing materials

## Notes

### Design Decisions
- **No user accounts required for orders**: Reduces friction, uses email + tracking token
- **Separate admin auth**: Keeps admin interface secure without complicating user flow
- **Tracking tokens**: UUID-based, secure, shareable links
- **GST included in all prices**: Transparent pricing for Australian customers
- **Photo-based key copying**: Innovative approach, requires verification for security

### Potential Issues
- **Photo quality**: May need guidelines for users to take clear photos
- **Key type identification**: May require manual review by staff
- **Locksmith availability**: Need system to manage locksmith schedules
- **Delivery times**: Dependent on Australia Post, need buffer in estimates
- **Verification delays**: Could slow down order processing

### Future Enhancements
- Mobile app (React Native)
- Subscription plans for businesses
- Bulk ordering for property managers
- Integration with smart lock systems
- Loyalty program
- Referral system
- Multi-language support
- International expansion
